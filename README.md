A responsive portfolio website I created using React, JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS

## Features:

I created a variety of unique features on my portfolio website:
- Dynamic header/navbar that changes as you scroll down the page to become a sidebar
- Implemented react-tsparticles and conditional settings via useEffect, useCallback, useState in order to make the particles start after 3 seconds of page load
- Used react-typed, useState, and useEffect to create the typewriter effects on my portfolio
- Certain advanced CSS features such as my contact card images glowing on hover and my "RG" logo glowing on hover of the navbar and website header
- Work, Skills, Projects, Contact, and Resume sections
